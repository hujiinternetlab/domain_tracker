This project is an extension for the chrome browser that has two purposes - 

1)Allow users who find it hard to keep away from certain sites (e.g Youtube) when they need to do more important things to limit themselves to a certain time period. The user chooses what domains
he wishes to be alerted on and the time limit he allows himself to have - once this time limit is up the user is alerted either via email or to the webpage
itself (or both). No more than one mail a day of alert , and no more than one alert to the webpage every 10 minutes.  The users can add any number of domains
for and remove or reset them at any time he pleases if he wants to stop the 'nagging' . 

2)Receive a weekly statistics of all domains visited including amount of time spent on them and number of visits.

The extension is accompanied by server-side code (in server_side dir) that takes care of handling a database (each domain for tracking is added to the database) . The domains of
the weekly statistics report or erased every week by a cron. 

 Notes
