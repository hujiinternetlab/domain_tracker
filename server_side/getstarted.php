 Once you are logged in , simply click on 'add' to start tracking a specific domain<br>.The extension will recognize whenever you
 visit that domain and aggregate the amount of time you spend there , once you go over your limit you will be let know of that 
 by a way of your choosing<br> (either email or an alert to said webpage or both). You will get no more than one mail a day but the alerts
 to the wepage will keep coming every 10 minutes. If you want to stop this nagging either reset  delete or update  the domain's time limit ,else
 you will be continued to be nagged indefinitely (which could be good if you are a hopeless Facebook addict).
